# One Core React Components

React Native UI components for the [Procivis One Wallet][wallet].

The Procivis One Wallet uses the [Procivis One Core][core] for all SSI functionality
via the [One Core React Native SDK][rncore].

The Procivis One Core is a complete solution capable of powering every element
of the digital identity credential lifecycle. See the complete solution [architecture][archi].

## How to use the One Core React Components

- Use the library for UI elements for your digital wallet app
- Use the [Procivis One Wallet][wallet] for a free-standing solution that can be white-labeled
- Use the [One Core React Native SDK][rncore] to embed wallet capabilities into an existing app

## Getting started

### Trial

The fastest way to get started with the Procivis One Wallet is to download the app
